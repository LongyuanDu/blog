The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ultratrail.it/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Lavaredo Ultra Trail&lt;/a&gt; is a 120km ultra trail race with 5800m of elevation gain in the Dolomites.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I logged less than 500 miles of running in 2017 before the race. I should have run a lot more often considering how mild this winter was in Toronto. A significant portion of the runs were done on the trails. It turns out that downtown Toronto has some very nice &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/987711599&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;single tracks&lt;/a&gt;. Given my training, I set my goal at 24 hours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre Race&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was supposed to arrive at Venice on Thursday morning (Jun. 22nd), so I could spend a day getting some rest. But I missed the flight due to the long delay at LaGuardia on my way back from a conference. I had to rebook the flight next day, landingat Venice on Friday morning (Jun. 23rd). I then took the ATVO bus at the airport to Cortina and arrived at the nice little ski town at 1:30pm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then had my gear checked and got my bib at the ice stadium. I spent most of the time dozing at the lobby of the hotel I would stay in after the race. I was still sleep deprived when the race starts at 11pm, but the exciting music and speech pumped my adrenaline up. So off we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/224698518&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortina (0km) -&amp;nbsp;Cimabanche (66 km)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ran cross the town and soon started our first climb of 500m. The trail was crowded at first, and it was a bit frustrating at the descent, when I had to constantly slow down. Fatigue crept up on me just a couple of hours into the race, probably a result of my lack of training and lack of sleep. I decided to have a gel every 90 minutes, and that brought some strength to my legs. I did not linger in the first two aid stations,&amp;nbsp;Ospitale (18km) and&amp;nbsp;Federavecchia (33km). My rank moved up to 808 at Misurina (42km).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the lovely Lake Misurina, we started our 600m ascent towards&amp;nbsp;Forc. Lavaredo. I ran out of gels by then, and the lack of calorie made the last part of the climb to Refugio Auronzo quite tiresome. So when I finally arrived at the welcoming refugio, I decided to stay longer to eat as much as I can and get some rest. Half an hour later, I started off again, feeling great. After a short climb, I arrived at Forc. Laveredo. It was a highlight of the race, with a gorgeous panorama view of the Dolomites. I felt very good at the 1000m descent, and passed a good number of runners when I reached the bottom of the valley. After that it was another 5k of dirt road gently uphill. By then the sun was out and there was little shade. I tried to push the pace, but soon it was reduced to walking again. After a miserable hour, I reached the Cimabanche (66km).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[singlepic id = 813 width =500]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cimabanche (66km) - Cortina (120km):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Cimabanche, I got my drop bag. I had a set of clean clothes in the bag, but because of the heat, I decided to keep my singlets and shorts and &amp;nbsp;only change my socks. After a brief rest, I left the aid station for the climb up to Forc. Lerosa. I was breathing heavily on way up, but the heart rate remains under 130, and I couldn't pick up the pace either. I arrived at&amp;nbsp;Malga Ra Stua (76km) at 1:10pm. I took a 40 minute rest lying on the grass, trying to regain some energy for the next stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next section over Forc. Col dei Bos, is the toughest of the race, with over 1000m of elevation gain in 10 kilometers. From Malga Ra Stua, there's first a descent of 300m, and then we turned into valley Val Travenanzes and started the march to the pass. Half way into the valley and the sun was gone. A thunderstorm was developing. I always thought with all the hiking, I should be good at those long climbs. Well not really. People were passing me right and left. I gathered all my strength so that I would keep on walking, but that was all I could manage. At 4:47pm, I arrived at Malga&amp;nbsp;Travenanzes (89km), a short stop with water and some light refreshments. I must have looked terrible that the volunteers assumed that I was going to drop out, and told me that I could do so at the next check point. Despite all the struggle, dropping out never crossed my mind. I was mildly offended so I waved them off and got back on the trail.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[singlepic id = 834 width = 500]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After what seemed like an eternity, I finally got to the top of Forc. Col dei Bos (91km), 2331m above sea level. By then it started drizzling and temperature dropped. Fortunately I was already heading down, and the rain was fairly mild. At 6:44pm, I arrived at Col Gallina (96km). After a brief rest, I started the 400m ascent to Refugio Averau. The rest of the race was a blur to me. I was exhausted and all I could manage was to put one foot in front of the other. &amp;nbsp;My pace was reduced to a pathetic 30min/mile. Nonetheless, I kept pushing and reached Refugio Averau (100km) at 8:33pm. It was mostly downhill for the next 4km. Another hour later, I arrived at Passo Giau (104km). From Passo Giau, there was a short but steep climb of about 200m. By then it was completely dark, so I had to be more careful of the footing. Looking up, there was a long line of runners with their bright headlamps. &amp;nbsp;It meant that there was still a long way to the top. This was disheartening, particularly at this stage of the race. Even though it didn't rain much, the thunder and lightening was unsettling. &amp;nbsp;My fellow runners seemed pretty chill though. It did help me speed up, as I was legitimately worried that I might get hit. I got to Mondeval (107km) at 11:02pm. There was one finally climb of 120m, before I finally reached the top of Forc. Ambrizzola at 2271m above sea level. Afterwards it's all downhill, all the way back to Cortina. I arrived at Refugio Croda da Lago (111km) at 11:45pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was quite relieved when I got to the refugio. When I was sitting there taking a break, I suddenly lost all the motivations. I was talking to a fellow runner when I realized that I had to finish within 26 hours to qualify for Western States. So I would have little chance to qualify. As a result, I spent more time than I should have at the aid station. For some stupid reason, I also did not refill my water bottle. When I left the refugio, the rain was heavier, but the thunder and lightning died down as we were now below tree level. The trail was slippery from the rainfall. There were quite a few runners right in front me, so I had to be careful sliding down so that I would not crash into them. It was quite frustrating. After a while, I gave up and settled with walking pace. After an hour, I ran out of water, and even though I could see the town from time to time, the trail just didn't seem to end. I arrived at the final check point Lago D'Ajal(116km) at 1:16am. Shortly afterwards, we finally got to the end of the single track and were back on paved road. Physically and mentally, I was done by then. The last 3km took me 45 minutes. I barely gathered enough strength to jog the last 100 meters as I approached the finish line to put an end to the race. Officially, I finished after 27:02 hours at 2:02am on Sunday morning and ranked at 880 out of 1070 finishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[singlepic id = 838 width = 350]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post Race Reflections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning from my experience at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mountain-du.com/2017/01/ttf/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ultra Trail Tai Mo Shan TTF&lt;/a&gt;, I did some specific training running downhills. So I was much more comfortable pushing the pace now during downhill. It also put less stress on my knees. The gels also helped a great deal in the first half. If I would force myself to take them the second half, I might have run faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major problem I had is the lack of volume in training. Had I run more leading to the race, I should be able to finish within 24 hours. Also I lost a lot of time going uphill. I pushed as hard as I could, but I was slow and heart rate was low. I think the problem was about the leg muscles. I need to hit the gym and do some leg workouts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived at Hong Kong in the afternoon of Dec. 30th. After I picked up the racer pack at Fo Tan (火炭), I walked around downtown and did some sightseeing in the evening. I&amp;nbsp;may have lingered on the street of the Pearl of the Orient too long that my hamstring felt a &amp;nbsp;little tight. Fortunately after a good night's sleep the slight discomfort went away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The race starts at 4pm, so I enjoyed a leisurely morning the next day. After a last-minute carb loading lunch at a brunch place, I headed to&amp;nbsp;Tsuen King Circuit (荃灣荃景圍遊樂場) at 2:30pm. I got my mandatory gear checked by the volunteers, checked in my two drop bags for Tai Tong and the finish line, and I was ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;[singlepic id = 799 width =300]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tsuen Wan 荃灣 (0km) - Tai Tong&amp;nbsp;大棠 (65km)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right after the start, the course climbed some 350 meters to Lian Fa Shan (蓮花山) via Shek Lung Kung (石龍拱), before dropping to CP1 Farm Milk 農場鮮奶&amp;nbsp;(13km) at 5:35pm. The distance is a bit off for CP1. It is listed as&amp;nbsp;13km, but really just around 10k from start. I rested for 10 minutes at the check point, and headed back on the course. The next 5k&amp;nbsp;was relatively flat on paved road and I was able to run most of them at a pace of around 10min/mile. Afterwards the elevation rose again to 390m at Tin Fu Tsai Shan (田夫仔山) and I went back to power hiking. From Tin Fu Tsai Shan the course descended&amp;nbsp;all the way back to sea level at CP2 Sham Tseng 深井&amp;nbsp;(30km). I felt&amp;nbsp;fairly good and&amp;nbsp;passed quite a few runners along the way, arriving at the check point&amp;nbsp;at 7:51pm.&amp;nbsp;There's a big gathering at&amp;nbsp;Sham Tseng, and the volunteers were serving fresh roast goose&amp;nbsp;and noodles, along with the usual race food. I must have eaten at least 20 pieces of goose. If there has to be a criticism about the race, it is that the check points were too cozy, that it was hard for me to head back to running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;[singlepic id = 791 width=500]&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent 30 minutes at&amp;nbsp;Sham Tseng and set&amp;nbsp;out again at 8:20pm. The elevation change was mostly moderate and I made good progress, arriving at CP4 Tai Tong 大棠 (65km) at 1:51am. By then my quads were a bit sore from pounding the paved paths and hard-surface trails, but overall I felt good. While sitting there resting I did the math: I covered 65km in 10 hours, so I was pretty confident that I could finish in 20 hours, and maybe even 18 hours. Boy, I couldn't be more wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;[singlepic id = 786 width =500]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tai Tong&amp;nbsp;大棠 (65km) - Fo Tan&amp;nbsp;火炭 (115km)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After leaving Tai Tong, the course followed the Tai Tong Shan Road briefly&amp;nbsp;and then followed the trail to&amp;nbsp;Sze Pai Shek Shan (四排石山). Sze Pai Shek Shan is really four hill and the trail was basically on the ridge. Although the highest hilltop is only 290m, the ups and downs were quite annoying. It took me around one and a half hours to reach SCP5 (Semi Check Point, where volunteers check you in with a mobile app). Afterwards the trail dropped sharply by 100m, ascended again to Cheung Ngau Shan (掌牛山) at 220m, and finally dropping back to sea level. It was at night and tall weeds grew right next to the trail, making it hard to see what I was stepping onto. I lost my footing a number of times, but fortunately only suffered some minor scratches. After I finally got out of the single tracks&amp;nbsp;and rejoined the paved road, I missed a turn where the course followed&amp;nbsp;a pedestrian subway. I had to backtrack and lost another 15 minutes because of that. I arrived at CP5&amp;nbsp;Fung Kat Heung&amp;nbsp;逢吉鄉 (78km) at 5:31am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From&amp;nbsp;Fung Kat Heung, the course&amp;nbsp;followed the ridge all the way up to Kai Kung Leng 圭角山 at 585m, then dropped back to 50m above sea level at SCP6 Ta Shek Wu 打石湖 (85km).&amp;nbsp;I handled the climb okay, but I started to struggle at the descent as my quads gave out. The steep slope on hard-surface trail certaintly didn't do me any favor and my pace at the descent was even slower than at the ascent. I pulled into Ta Shek Wu at 7:49am. After a brief rest I took off again, climbing 500m to Tai To Yan (大刀屻).&amp;nbsp;I took a couple of gels and seemed to recover a little. Quad weren't hurting as bad so I managed to pick up the pace on the descent to CP6. I pulled into CP6 Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden&amp;nbsp;嘉道理農場 (93km) at 10:24am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;[singlepic id = 776 width =300]&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after leaving the check point, battery of my Fenix2 drained and I had to run by feels The climb to the highest point&amp;nbsp;of the race, the 780m Sze Fong Shan (四方山),&amp;nbsp;took me two hours. When I finally reached that point, the course took a steep dip down a side trail. I had struggled throughout the race with those descents on hard-surface trails, and at that point my quads were completed wrecked. While I was stumbling down the hill,&amp;nbsp;racers were passing me left and right. I arrived at CP7 Wun Yiu 碗窰 (105km) exhausted at 1:40pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;[singlepic id = 777 width =500 ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yours truly on Sze Fong Shan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was actually surprised that it was not even 2pm when I got to the check point. This got my hope up that I had a chance to finish the race in 24 hours.&amp;nbsp;There was one more hill, the 640m Grassy Hill 草山, to climb in the last segment.&amp;nbsp;It took another me 80 minutes and I was finally up on top at 3:13pm. The way down was mostly on paved road, and I got an&amp;nbsp;adrenaline rush closer to the finish line, so despite my quads discomfort, I picked up the pace, shuffled down as fast as I could and crossed the line at 4:02pm, and the finish time is 24:02:57. I was a little bummed that I had missed 24 hours by less than 3 minutes, but ultimately I was more than happy to have finished this very tough race.&lt;/p&gt;

I got my mandatory gear checked by the volunteers, checked in my two drop bags for Tai Tong and the finish line, and I was ready to go. [singlepic id = 799 width =300]</summary></entry></feed>
