<p>In 2013 I was working and living in suburban Philadelphia. At the end of September I still got 6 vacation days left, and at most 5 can be accumulated to the next year. So I decided to take Friday off for a hike. After some research, I found Black Forest Trail to be a perfect hike for the long weekend. It is about 200 miles from where I lived. It was relatively rugged and provide some good vistas overlooking the valleys. Also no permit is needed for the hike.</p>
<p>The hike was enjoyable. Weather was great and there weren't many people on the trail. Campsites were abundant and fire was allowed.</p>
<p>Overall, the hike is not difficult. There are quite a few up and downs, but trail is well maintained. The whole thing can be done comfortably in 3 days.</p>
