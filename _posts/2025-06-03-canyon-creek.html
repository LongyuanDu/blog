<p>Our son Riley recently turned 4. It's finally time to introduce him to the wonderful hobby of backpacking! We set out to Trinity Alps on May 25th to hike the Canyon Creek Lakes Trail. </p>

 <p>We drove from Eureka and spent the night at Weaverville on May 24th. From Weaverville, it's 40 minutes drive to the Canyon Creek Trailhead, mostly along the narrow but paved Canyon Creek Road. We arrived at the trailhead at noon, and the parking lot was nearly full due to the Memorial Day long weekend.</p>

<p>The trail climbed gradually in the first 3 miles. The woods provided some nice shades to cool us down. Afterwards it opened up into the valley. Our original plan was to camp at either Boulder Creek Lakes or Canyon Creek Lakes - it's about 7 miles one-way with 2,500 feet of ascent. It became apparent later in the afternoon that we would not make it to the lakes. We started searching for campsites as we walked along the Canyon Creek. While there were few bugs during our most of hike, it had become a nuisance by 6.  We decided to walk a little further, and found a nice open area on the Boulder Creek Lakes trail just after the trail junction. </p>

<p>The next day, we decided to leave our stuffs at camp and take a quick trip to the lakes. The approach to Boulder Creek Lakes involves wading through a large creek just after the split. While crossable, it wasn't too appealing to start with wet feet right from the beginning. We turned around and set out to the Canyon Creek Lakes. It was a 2-mile hike  with a moderate elevation gain, but the many creek crossings and muddy sections slowed us down considerably.</p>

<p>The "quick" trip ended up taking 4 hours. We returned to the trail junction at noon. By then, we were all tired. On his first backpacking trip, Riley was a total trooper and hiked most of the way up and down the lake. When asked what he wanted after the hike, he said that all he wanted was gummy bears. Fueled by the promise of gummy bears, Riley kept marching on. We finally reached the trailhead at 5. </p>
