<blockquote>La Cloche Silhouette Trail is a 78 km loop trail located in Killarney Provincial Park, ON. I hiked it during Canada Thanksgiving weekend from Oct. 10th to Oct. 13th in 2014. While La Cloche Silhouette Trail&nbsp;may not be the best trail in the world, it offers a really nice multi-day backcountry hiking experience that is within a few hours’ drive from Toronto.</blockquote>
<strong>Logistics:</strong>

Killarney Provincial Park is about 500 km from Toronto.

<a href="http://parkbus.ca/killarney.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parkbus</a> runs a routine bus service between&nbsp;downtown Toronto and the park. My experience with them was great!&nbsp;It was a very smooth and comfortable ride and the volunteers on board were very helpful.

<strong>Route:</strong>

There’s not much difference whether you hike clockwise or counterclockwise. I prefer clockwise only because west&nbsp;part of the trail is quite muddy, and wet feet at the end of the hike is slightly more annoying to me. Depend on the availability of campsites, you probably don’t have a choice about the route anyways.

There’s a nice&nbsp;map online <a href="http://www.thekillarneymap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. I find the quoted time between campsites to be fairly accurate. Use this map to figure out where you want to camp each night. Theoretically all backcountry campsites accommodate one group only per night. They offers great privacy but it also means the spots are limited. Make sure you reserve them in advance at ON park service by phone. There are a few places where you can probably “sneak camp”, but don’t count on that. The only place I know of is H16. The official campsite is set on a beach next to the lake, and there’s a nice open area outside before you turn into the site.

&nbsp;

<strong>Difficulty:</strong>

Ontario Park’s website rates the trail as “strenuous” and recommends 7-10 days to finish. In fact, if you plan to do it within 5 days, you will be flagged as “high risk” on your permit, meaning you will be responsible for&nbsp;the evacuation fees if necessary. This is pathetic. True that this trail is not suitable for a first-time backcountry hiking trip, but IMO an average hiker can do it in 5 days quite comfortably. The trail has a few muddy sections, but overall is easy to follow. Only thing worth mentioning is the slippery rocks. Take extra care when climbing bare rocks.

<strong>Killarney is a bear country. Although I have not seen any bear activities during my hike, hang your food to a tree, just to be safe.&nbsp;</strong>
